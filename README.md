# "LED's Signal" (Let's signal !)

This is an educational project I had a lot of fun with.

Goal is to use LED panel x Raspberry Pi to display any info or signals (ie. trading, transport, weather and more)

This tutorial is to guide you to build your own LED Signal panel with Raspberry Pi 3B.

Enjoy !
